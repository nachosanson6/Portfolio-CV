## Setup

#### Prerequisites

Follow the steps below to setup the application in your local development environment:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open automatically on localhost (port 5173 if it's not in use already).

To create a production build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Scripts

The following commands can be found in the [`package.json`](./package.json) file in the project root. To execute them, simply use the command the following way:

```
npm run <command>
```
